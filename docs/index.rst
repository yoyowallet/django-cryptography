Welcome to django-cryptography
==============================

A set of primitives for easily encrypting data in Django, wrapping
the Python Cryptography_ library. Also provided is a drop in
replacement for Django's own cryptographic primitives, using
Cryptography_ as the backend provider.

Why another encryption library for Django?
------------------------------------------

The motivation for making django-cryptography_ was from the
general frustration of the existing solutions. Libraries such as
django-cryptographic-fields_ and django-crypto-fields_ do not allow
a way to easily work with custom fields, being limited to their own
provided subset. As well as many others lacking Python 3 and modern
Django support.
